Include anything else you want to say, such as the difficulties you faced or overcame, the things you learned, what you enjoyed, etc, in a readme file.

The difficulties I faced were. making the light turn off once you step out of the door. Picking up a flashlight, a trigger to make a jumpscare, and a chase scene in the bedroom 
I learn how to make a first-person, walk and jump, create a map, and create an animation. I enjoy how I would plan out everything that would work but have no time for certain parts. It
took about 3 - 5 hours a day to figure out the controls and buttons.
